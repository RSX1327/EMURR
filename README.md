# EMURR
Exhibit Marker Uniform Resource Router

## CAD Models
Models for EMURR router built around a TP-Link Archer C1200 Router. The critical dimension is stored in the DXF file. All of these files should be printed PETG to allow for some flexibility. Print settings: .4 Initial Layer Height, .15 Layer Height, 240/90deg temps, 15% infill gyroid, and no need for support. 3MF files are better quality but the STLs are included for previewing purposes.
