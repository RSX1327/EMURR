# EMURR
EMURR, or Exhibit Marker Uniform Resource Router is a mobile closed loop platform for deploying digital media content to devices using WiFi in geographical areas that have lacking infrastructure and reception. The working prototype uses the following components:
- TP-Link Archer C1200 Router (12v/1amp)
- Raspberry Pi Zero W (5v/1.5amp)
- 12V/11000mAh DC Output Battery w/2.1mm x 5.5mm output
- MicroUSB Cable


## CAD Models
Models for EMURR router built around a TP-Link Archer C1200 Router. The critical dimension is stored in the DXF file. All of these files should be printed PETG to allow for some flexibility. Print settings: .4 Initial Layer Height, .15 Layer Height, 240/90deg temps, 15% infill gyroid, and no need for support. 3MF files are better quality but the STLs are included for previewing purposes.
