# EMURR
EMURR, or **Exhibit Marker Uniform Resource Router** is a mobile closed loop platform for deploying digital media content to devices using WiFi in geographical areas that have lacking infrastructure and reception. The working prototype uses the following components:
- TP-Link Archer C1200 Router (12v/1amp)
- Raspberry Pi Zero W (5v/1.5amp)
- 12V/11000mAh DC Output Battery w/2.1mm x 5.5mm output
- MicroUSB Cable


## CAD Models
Models for EMURR display CHDR branding and enable the router to be hung on a pull along cart or from a backpack. The critical dimension of the router mount is stored in the DXF file. 3MF files are better quality but the STLs are included for previewing purposes. 

### Print Settings
All of these files should be printed PETG to allow for some flexibility. 
- .4 Initial Layer Height
- .15 Layer Height
- 240/90deg extruder/bed temps
- 15% infill (gyroid or rectilinear) and no need for support structures
